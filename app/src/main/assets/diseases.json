    "name": "Scub",
    "symptom": "Primary infection on lower surface of leaves . Spots develop as olivaceous and turn dark brown to black and become  velvety, may coalesce to cover the whole surface.\n     Secondary infection occurs on upper surface and leaves become twisted or puckered with black circular spots.\n    Fruits show small, black ,circular lesions on their skin both on trees as well as after cold storage. Entire fruit surface is susceptible to infection but infections early in the season generally cluster around the calyx end. Late summer or early fall may not be visible till storage, leading to pin point scab.",

    "symptom": "Spots are 1/8 to Â¼ inches in diameter, round, brown and occasionally purple border. Some spots are grayish brown.\nMost of them undergo secondary enlargement and become irregular and more darker, acquiring frogeye appearance.\nInfection on petioles leads to 50% defoliation\nFruit infection results in small, dark, raised pimple like lesions associated  with lenticels (often resembles lenticels blotch)",
